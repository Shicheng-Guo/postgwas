buffer data concept changed (see help(postgwasBuffer)).  
gwas2network: The legend of graphs can now be plotted to a separate box (new default)
gwas2network: Major change in community p-value calculations and GO enrichment (see documentation)

Manhattanplot: Can draw calibration lines now (argument highlight.lines)
getGenotypes: Extended, now also handles GenABEL (gwaa) files
getGenotypes: Extended, can now write retrieved genotypes to ped/map and gwaa/phe files
getGenotypes: Default argument list and return value definition has been changed 
Snp2gene: Argument list changed
RemoveNeighborSnps: Bugfix in p-value pruning version for certain overlapping region constellations
getInteractions: getInteractions.ppi has been removed due to unavailability of the REST access to biogrid. 
                 A new getInteractions.path function has been added to generate networks of pathway data from REACTOME biomart.
